\begin{frame}{Purpose, Scope and Objectives}
\textbf{Purpose}
\begin{itemize}
	\item To create a means to see the condition of each service, its cost, and funding gap to be able to make educated decisions about future investments and divestitures. In addition, to possibly standardize a single service catalogs across all Ohio State University entities.
\end{itemize}
\textbf{Scope and Objectives}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Create a dashboard to monitor use of IT services
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Current condition of operations services in the Service Portfolio
	\item Clearly defined criteria for investing and dissociating from services
	\item Service Portfolio content translucent and noticeable via the dashboard.
\end{enumerate}
\end{itemize}
